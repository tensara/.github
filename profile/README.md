For April 2025, our primary goals are to:
- [ ] Solidify our GPU infrastructure (how we validate + benchmark solutions)
- [ ] Refactor the frontend codebase to reduce the friction for contributions 
- [ ] Improve the _variety_ of problems (add graphics, scientific computing tasks)
- [ ] Implement authentication for our CLI
- [ ] Add in-browser sample testing/compilation
- [ ] Support FP8/FP16
- [ ] Improve CI/CD (e2e testing) 
- [ ] Add sanity tests for adding problems

Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/tensara/projects/1) for more specifics. We value open-source highly and are committed to transparency in all aspects of our development process.

Issues, feature requests, and pull requests are all welcome. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:hello@tensara.org)!
