For April 2025, our primary goals are to:
- [ ] Solidify our GPU infrastructure (how we validate + benchmark solutions)
- [ ] Refactor the frontend codebase to reduce the friction for contributions 
- [ ] Improve the _variety_ of problems (add graphics, scientific computing tasks)
- [ ] Implement authentication for our CLI
- [ ] Add in-browser sample testing/compilation
- [ ] Support FP8/FP16
